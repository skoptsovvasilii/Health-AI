## 👋 Hello!

This project was created by me for school and city science conferences.  
**Health-AI** is an autonomous system that monitors a patient’s condition during surgery using:

- ECG signals  
- camera video  
- additional sensor data  

The program detects possible complications and gives their probabilities in real time.

---

<h2>📌 System Components</h2>

1. 🫀 **ECG model** — a ResNet1D network for classifying lead-II ECG signals  
2. 📷 **Vision model** — a ResNet50 for detecting complications using the patient’s face  
3. 📈 **Sensor algorithm** — checks complications using external sensor readings  
4. 🔁 **Re-check algorithm** — compares AI outputs with rule-based logic  
5. 🎛️ **Final probability module** — combines all predictions  
6. 🖥️ **Interface program** — the main window with alerts and visualization  

---

<h2>🚀 How to Run</h2>

1. Install **PyCharm** or any Python IDE  
2. Install **Python 3.9**  
3. Install libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Likitha456/Health-ai.git
cd Health-ai

2. Fibrillation  
3. Myocardial infarction  
4. Hypoxia  
5. Allergic reaction  
6. Coagulation problems  
7. Shock  
8. Cyanosis  
9. Jugular vein swelling

<h2>🧠 About the Models</h2>

### 🫀 ECG Model (ResNet1D)
- Trained for **50–60 epochs**  
- Dataset: **31,000 lead-II ECG signals**  
- Input:  
- 2,500 ECG points  
- 2,500 derivative points  
- You can test the system using **Arduino ECG sensors**  

### 📷 Vision Model (ResNet50)
- Trained on **5,000 photos**  
- Detects the face using OpenCV  
- Can work with your webcam  

### 🔁 Re-check Algorithm
This module compares:
- the AI predictions  
- the rule-based sensor algorithm  

Then a linear regression gives a **final probability** of the complication.
