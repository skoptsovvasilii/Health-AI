<h1 algin="center">⚕️ Health-AI - an AI assistant for doctors during operations</h1>
👋 Hello everyone, <br />
 My name is Vasilii Skoptsov, I'm a 10th class student at School №626. This project was created by me for school city conferences.<br />
Health-AI is an autonomous program capable of independently monitoring a patient's condition during surgery using ECG data and video from the operating room, identifying potential complications and determining their probabilities.
<h1>📌 It consists of the following components</h1>
  1. an AI based on ResNet1D for classification of second-lead ECG signals. 🫀<br /> 
  2. an AI based on ResNet50 for complication classification by facial features. 📷<br />
  3. an algorithm that iterates through possible complications based on sensor readings. 📈<br />
